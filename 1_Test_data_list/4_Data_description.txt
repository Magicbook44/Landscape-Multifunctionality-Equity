1_ES_equivalent_table：For the quantification of ecosystem service provision, we use the value equivalence approach. Xie et al. referenced Costanz et al.'s study and constructed an ecosystem service classification and value equivalence table for China based on the understanding of ecosystem services by the Chinese public and policy makers, and the ecosystem service classification used corresponds to Costanz's classification and the CICES classification, as shown in Table S1. On this basis, we corrected the equivalence table with the actual situation in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (Table S2, Table S3) and obtained the ecosystem service equivalence table for the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (Table S4).The specific calculation process is shown in the annex.

2_Priority score statistics：In January 2024, we held an expert workshop in Chongqing Municipality, inviting professors from three universities, members of the Academy of Social Sciences, members of think tanks and other sectors totaling more than a dozen experts and scholars, we pre-determined 18 groups of stakeholders through the theory of the ecological value chain, and after synthesizing the expert's opinions, we made certain additions, deletions and mergers of the interest groups, and ultimately identified 14 groups of interests.Then, we conducted a prioritization survey in January-April 2024 for all stakeholder groups. Considering that our online questionnaire may be difficult to reach certain groups (e.g., agricultural practitioners, forestry practitioners, etc.), we supplemented the questionnaire with field research in rural areas, seedling nurseries, and aquaculture bases, along with more understandable explanations of specialized knowledge to enable respondents to understand the concepts related to ecosystem services. Respondents were first asked which stakeholder group they felt they belonged to, and then asked to give up to five points for the service, depending on their personal priorities and their affiliation with a particular stakeholder group. Response scores were then scaled by the total score given by each respondent and averaged for each group. All stakeholder groups were represented and, overall, the questionnaire data revealed the cultural worldviews, nature views and socio-cultural factors of the different groups.
