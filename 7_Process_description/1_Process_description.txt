1. Unconstrained simulation（1_Unconstrained_Simulation.py）: firstly, generate the 0%-100% full inter-area land use combinations without considering the realistic constraints for the time being, and analyze the theoretical maximum influence law of the proportion of land classes on the ecosystem service function and fairness, so as to establish the baseline reference for the subsequent research.

2. Planning constraint modeling（2_Custom_Simulation.py）: Based on the Chongqing Territorial Spatial Master Plan (2021-2035), the ratio of arable land (paddy land + dry land) to water is fixed; construction land is controlled by 1.3 times of the 2020 baseline scale; and the rest of the land categories are allowed to fluctuate by ±50%, so as to construct a landscape combination simulation under the real-life constraint scenario.

3. Structural optimization analysis（3_Land_type_conversion.py；4_Land_type_conversion(internal).py；5_Land_type_conversion(average).py）: carry out component scenario experiments for specific land types, including grass cover type conversion, woodland type combination, and grass-forest interconversion and other landscape structural adjustments, to deeply analyze the mechanism of landscape component changes on the ecological services and equity of the reservoir area.
